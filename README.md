# shika-translations

We are always looking for people who want to become translators for their native language and contribute to translation for Shika.

We are currently looking for translators for the languages: `PH`.

If you want to become a translator:
1. Create a Pull Request and attach a Json file with a translation of a few lines in your native language.
2. Wait for a response from us.
3. Get your role on [Discord server](https://discord.gg/shika-hub) and start working.

P.S. Unfortunately, your translation work will not be paid in any way and you will not be required to do it all the time - take this into account before submitting it.
